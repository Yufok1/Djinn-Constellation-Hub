## üîÑ INTELLIGENT ROUTING

### How Routing Works

The Constellation Hub uses intelligent routing to determine which federation model should handle each query:

#### **Routing Logic:**
1. **Query Analysis:** Analyzes user intent and query complexity
2. **Model Selection:** Chooses the most appropriate federation model
3. **Response Generation:** Gets response from selected model
4. **Memory Storage:** Stores interaction for learning and context

#### **Routing Criteria:**
- **constellation:** Complex problem solving, coordination tasks
- **council:** Ethical decisions, philosophical questions, meta-analysis
- **idhhc:** Coding tasks, system design, operational strategy
- **companion:** General conversation, emotional support, mystical guidance

### Example Routing

```
User: "I need to build a web application with user authentication"

Routing Decision: idhhc
Reason: Technical implementation and coding task

User: "What are the ethical implications of AI in healthcare?"

Routing Decision: council
Reason: Ethical analysis and philosophical consideration

User: "I'm feeling lost about my life direction"

Routing Decision: companion
Reason: Emotional support and soul-level guidance
```
