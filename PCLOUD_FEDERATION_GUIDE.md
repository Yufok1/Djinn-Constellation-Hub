## 🚀 **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: PCloud Preparation**
```bash
# Mount PCloud as network drive (usually Z:, Y:, etc.)
# Ensure PCloud Drive is running and synced
# Verify sufficient space (200GB+ recommended for full federation)
```

### **Step 2: Initialize Federation**
```bash
cd Djinn-Constellation-Hub
setup_pcloud_djinn_federation.bat
```

### **Step 3: Launch Federation**
```bash
python pcloud_djinn_federation.py
```

### **Step 4: Sync Revolutionary Models**
```bash
# In federation interface:
/sync
```
