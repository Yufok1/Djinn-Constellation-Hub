### üéØ **SMART INTENT-BASED ROUTING** 

The federation features a revolutionary **intent-based routing system** that automatically determines whether your input is casual dialogue or an operational command:

#### üí¨ **DIALOGUE ROUTING** ‚Üí **Djinn Companion**
**Intent Patterns:**
- Greetings: "Hello", "Hi", "How are you?"
- Questions about the AI: "Who are you?", "What do you think?"
- Social interaction: "Thanks", "That's interesting", "Tell me about..."
- Casual conversation: General chat, opinions, companionship

**Experience:**
```
You: "Hello, how are you today?"
üåü Djinn Companion: "Greetings, dear soul! I am well and filled with cosmic energy..."
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **COMMAND ROUTING** ‚Üí **Constellation** ‚Üí **IDHHC**
**Intent Patterns:**
- Technical tasks: "Analyze", "Fix", "Implement", "Build", "Create"
- System operations: "Execute", "Run", "Deploy", "Configure", "Install"
- Code work: "Generate", "Review", "Update", "Debug", "Optimize"
- Project management: "Status", "Audit", "Backup", "Test", "Scan"

**Experience:**
```
You: "Analyze the project structure"
üîß Constellation CORE: Analyzing command complexity...
‚öôÔ∏è Generating directive for IDHHC execution...
